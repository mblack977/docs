  <Step title="Purchase Access">
    Choose a plan that fits your needs. Plans include a fixed number of queries per billing period.
    
    Navigate to any knowledge base detail page and click **Purchase** on your preferred plan.
    
    <Tip>Start with a smaller plan to test the knowledge base before committing to higher volumes.</Tip>

  <Step title="Get Your API Key">
    After purchase, Ardie issues you a **scoped API key**. This key grants access only to the specific knowledge base you purchased.

  </Step>

  <Step title="Make Your First Query">
    Use your API key to send queries and receive answers with citations.
    
    ```bash
    curl -X POST https://api.ardie.ai/kb/{kb_id}/query \
      -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY" \
      -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
      -d '{"query": "Your question here"}'
    ```

      "answer": "The key curriculum standards for grade 5 math include...",
