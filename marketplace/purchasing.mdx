  <Step title="Click Purchase">
    Select your preferred plan and click the **Purchase** button.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Complete Payment">
    Enter your payment details. Ardie accepts major credit cards.

    After successful payment, your scoped API key is immediately available in your [Dashboard](https://ardie.ai/dashboard).

## After Purchase

Once you've purchased access:

1. **API Key Available** — Find your new key in the Dashboard
2. **Start Querying** — Use the key immediately to make API calls
3. **Monitor Usage** — Track queries used vs. your cap in real-time

## Managing Subscriptions

From your Dashboard, you can:

- **View all subscriptions** — See every knowledge base you have access to
- **Check usage** — Monitor queries used this billing period
- **Upgrade plans** — Move to a higher tier for more queries
- **Cancel access** — End your subscription at any time

<Note>
  Cancellations take effect at the end of your current billing period. You retain access until then.
