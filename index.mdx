## What is Ardie?

Ardie is a **knowledge infrastructure service** that allows individuals and organisations to turn documents, websites, and other authorised sources into **secure, reusable knowledge bases accessed via APIs**.

Instead of locking knowledge into a single chatbot or application, Ardie separates **knowledge ingestion, retrieval, and access control** from user interfaces and language models. Knowledge bases can be queried by websites, internal tools, chat interfaces, agents, and external applications using standard APIs—enabling the same curated knowledge to be reused consistently across many contexts.

## The Problem

Organisations increasingly rely on AI systems, but their knowledge is:

- **Scattered** across documents and websites
- **Duplicated** across multiple tools
- **Difficult to control**, audit, and share
- **Costly** to re-ingest and maintain

Most "chatbot" solutions bundle ingestion, retrieval, and generation together, making knowledge hard to reuse, hard to govern, and expensive to scale.

## How Ardie Solves This

  <Card title="Structured Ingestion" icon="file-import">
    Transform documents and web sources into queryable knowledge bases with proper indexing and metadata.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Controlled Access" icon="shield-check">
    API keys, permissions, and usage limits ensure you control who accesses your knowledge and how much.

## What Makes Ardie Different

<Note>
**Ardie is not a chatbot.** It is a **knowledge layer** that chatbots and other systems can use.
</Note>

By decoupling knowledge from presentation and generation, Ardie supports better governance, reuse, and long-term sustainability of AI-powered systems.
