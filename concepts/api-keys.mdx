## How API Keys Work

When you purchase access to a knowledge base, Ardie issues you a **scoped API key**. This key is your credential for querying that specific knowledge base via the API.

## Key Principles

<CardGroup cols={1}>
  <Card title="Ardie-Issued" icon="shield-check">
    All API keys are issued by Ardie. You never receive supplier infrastructure keys or direct access to publisher systems.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Scoped Access" icon="lock">
    Each key grants access to exactly one knowledge base. If you purchase access to multiple knowledge bases, you'll have separate keys for each.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Revocable" icon="ban">
    Keys can be revoked at any time from your dashboard if compromised or no longer needed.
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

## API Key Format

Your API key will look something like:

```
ardie_sk_live_abc123xyz789...
```

The prefix indicates:
- `ardie_` — Issued by Ardie
- `sk_` — Secret key (keep confidential)
- `live_` — Production key (vs `test_` for sandbox)

## Managing Your Keys

Access your API keys from the [Dashboard](https://ardie.ai/dashboard). For each key, you can see:

| Field | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| **Knowledge Base** | Which KB this key grants access to |
| **Created At** | When the key was issued |
| **Last Used** | Most recent API call with this key |
| **Prefix** | First few characters for identification |

<Warning>
  **Never expose your API key in client-side code, public repositories, or logs.** Treat it like a password.
</Warning>

## Security Best Practices

<Steps>
  <Step title="Use Environment Variables">
    Store your API key in environment variables, not in code:
    ```bash
    export ARDIE_API_KEY="ardie_sk_live_..."
    ```
  </Step>
  <Step title="Rotate Keys Periodically">
    If you suspect a key may be compromised, revoke it immediately and generate a new one.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Use Server-Side Only">
    Make API calls from your backend server, never from browser JavaScript or mobile apps.
  </Step>
</Steps>
