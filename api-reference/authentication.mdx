## Bearer Token Authentication

All API requests require authentication using a Bearer token in the `Authorization` header.

```bash
Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY
```

## Making Authenticated Requests

Include your API key in every request:

<CodeGroup>
```bash cURL
curl -X POST https://api.ardie.ai/kb/{kb_id}/query \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"query": "Your question here"}'
```

```python Python
import requests

headers = {
    "Authorization": "Bearer YOUR_API_KEY",
    "Content-Type": "application/json"
}

response = requests.post(
    "https://api.ardie.ai/kb/{kb_id}/query",
    headers=headers,
    json={"query": "Your question here"}
)
```

```javascript JavaScript
const response = await fetch('https://api.ardie.ai/kb/{kb_id}/query', {
  method: 'POST',
  headers: {
    'Authorization': 'Bearer YOUR_API_KEY',
    'Content-Type': 'application/json'
  },
  body: JSON.stringify({ query: 'Your question here' })
});
```
</CodeGroup>

## Key Scoping

Each API key is scoped to a **single knowledge base**. This means:

- You can only query the knowledge base the key was issued for
- Attempting to query a different knowledge base returns `403 Forbidden`
- If you have access to multiple knowledge bases, you'll have separate keys for each

## Authentication Errors

| Status Code | Error | Description |
|-------------|-------|-------------|
| `401 Unauthorized` | `missing_api_key` | No Authorization header provided |
| `401 Unauthorized` | `invalid_api_key` | The API key is malformed or doesn't exist |
| `403 Forbidden` | `key_scope_mismatch` | The key doesn't have access to this knowledge base |
| `403 Forbidden` | `key_revoked` | The API key has been revoked |

**Example error response:**

```json
{
  "error": "invalid_api_key",
  "message": "The provided API key is invalid or has been revoked."
}
```

## Security Best Practices

<Warning>
  Never expose your API key in client-side code, public repositories, or logs.
</Warning>

<Steps>
  <Step title="Use Environment Variables">
    Store keys in environment variables:
    ```bash
    export ARDIE_API_KEY="ardie_sk_live_..."
    ```
  </Step>
  <Step title="Server-Side Only">
    Make API calls from your backend, never from browsers or mobile apps.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Rotate if Compromised">
    If a key is exposed, revoke it immediately from your Dashboard and generate a new one.
  </Step>
</Steps>
