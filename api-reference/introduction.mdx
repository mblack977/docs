## Overview

The Ardie API allows you to query knowledge bases programmatically. All interactions happen through REST endpoints using JSON payloads.

**Base URL:**
```
https://api.ardie.ai
```

## How API Exchange Works

Ardie acts as a secure intermediary between you and knowledge base publishers:

1. You purchase access to a knowledge base through the marketplace
2. Ardie issues you a **scoped API key** for that specific knowledge base
3. You use the key to query the knowledge base via the Ardie API
4. Ardie routes your query to the publisher's infrastructure and returns the response

<Info>
  **Key principle:** Buyers never receive supplier infrastructure keys. All keys are Ardie-issued, scoped, and revocable.

## Available Endpoints

| Endpoint | Method | Description |
|----------|--------|-------------|
| `/kb/{kb_id}/query` | POST | Query a knowledge base |
| `/api/marketplace/knowledge-bases` | GET | List available knowledge bases |

## Quick Example

```bash
curl -X POST https://api.ardie.ai/kb/{kb_id}/query \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"query": "What are the key curriculum standards for grade 5 math?"}'
```
